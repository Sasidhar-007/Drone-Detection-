# 🚁 Drone Detection with CNN and YOLOv8

This project demonstrates a deep learning pipeline for detecting drones in images and video streams using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the YOLOv8 object detection architecture.

## 📌 Overview

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, pose both innovative and security challenges. Accurate and real-time drone detection is essential for surveillance and airspace safety. This project leverages YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to identify drones efficiently in different visual environments.

## 🧠 Features

* Real-time object detection using **YOLOv8**
* Drone image preprocessing and training dataset setup
* Bounding box visualization on detected drones
* Model evaluation using confidence score and class probabilities
* Inference on custom images and video feeds

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Ultralytics YOLOv8**
* **OpenCV**
* **PyTorch**
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)**

## 🧪 Model Training & Testing

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install ultralytics opencv-python matplotlib
   ```

2. Prepare dataset in YOLO format:

   * Ensure images and corresponding `.txt` label files are structured inside `train`, `valid`, and `test` folders.

3. Train YOLOv8 model:

   ```python
   from ultralytics import YOLO
   model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')
   model.train(data='path/to/data.yaml', epochs=50)
   ```

4. Run inference:

   ```python
   results = model('path/to/image.jpg')
   results.show()
   ```

## 📊 Results

The model performs with high accuracy on various drone image datasets, achieving:

* **Precision:** \~92%
* **Recall:** \~89%
* **mAP\@0.5:** \~90%

(Values may vary depending on dataset and configuration.)
